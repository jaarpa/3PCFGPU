# Name of our project

*Code capable to compute the isotropic or anisotropic, two or three Points Correlation Functions (PCF) from galaxy catalogs, using parallel programming on GPU or CPU.*

The code in this repository is capable to compute and vizualize the correlation functions of given galaxy catalogs. This repository contains two versions capable to produce the same results; in the cpp directory you can find the CPU programs to compute the PCF using openMP parallel programming, in the cuda folder you can find
