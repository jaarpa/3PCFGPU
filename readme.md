# Name of our project

*Code capable to compute the isotropic or anisotropic, two or three Points Correlation Functions (PCF) from galaxy catalogs, using parallel programming on GPU or CPU.*

The code in this repository is capable to compute and vizualize the correlation functions of given galaxy catalogs. This repository contains two versions capable to produce the same results; in the cpp directory you can find the CPU programs to compute the PCF using openMP parallel programming, in the cuda folder the GPU programs are provided. 


## Prerequisites

### CPU
The CPU code has been tested using the GCC compilers and everything you could need is shipped with the GCC compilers.

### GPU
The GPU programs are developed using cuda and therefore a cuda capable GPU is required. If your computer has a capable GPU you must already have the nvidia `nvcc` compiler which you can do following [this instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html).

Since histograms involved in the correlation function computations usually reach large countings this code uses some double precision functions, therefore yout GPU must have at least a 7.5 compute capability. You can check your GPU compute capability [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

## Installation

Clone this repository using git or download the .zip folder from this webpage.
You can clone it by running `git clone https://github.com/jaarpa/DESI.git` in your terminal.

### CPU



### GPU

A master script has been provided for the easiest usage of the code. Place your terminal in the cuda folder of this repository and run `nvcc -arch=sm_75 main.cu -o PCF.out` to compile the master script, it may take a few seconds.
